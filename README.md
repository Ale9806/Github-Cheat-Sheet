### ADVANCE GIT
##### FORKING
A way of creating a copy of the given repository so that it belongs to our user.
To do a pull request (correct master code) you need to fork the repo and create a new branch.
You can only create 1 pull request per branch, though 1 pull request may have multiple commits 
##### CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION (CI/CD)
Continuos integration enables us to check our code is up and running everytime we create a commit
In ordet to apply CI with github you can use many 3rd parties solutions such as:
<ol>
  <li>Travis</li>
  <li>Jankins </li>
</ol>
